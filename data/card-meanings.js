        'past': "The Fool in the past position indicates that the risks you’ve taken in life to date have set things in motion to soon reward you with great success. By trusting your judgement and following your own path, you’ve set the stage for unlimited potential.",

        'present': "In the present position, the Fool indicates that you’re entering a new phase in your life. While this phase could either be positive or negative at the moment, its true influence will be far more apparent to you in the future. Weighing all of your options and assessing risk is paramount to your taking the right decisions.",

        'future': "Drawing the Fool in the future position suggests you will soon be embarking on a deeply personal, spiritual journey. You will be setting new goals for yourself and amassing a great wealth of knowledge.

        'past': "The Magician indicates that even though you have what it takes to grow spiritually, you did not do anything about it in the past.",

        'present': "The Magician in the present indicates that a recent event is making you discover your spiritual potential. This is a great time to do something that you have thought about in the past but did not take the steps to pursue. You are open and have an attentive ear to the inner voice that will guide you. It may lead you to looking for spiritual counsel, joining a group or following a spiritual guide.",

        'future': "You have drawn the Magician in the past position. This means that if a recent event has temporarily made it difficult for you to use the spiritual resources you have at hand, you may be inclined to use dangerous occult forces in order to reach your spiritual goals. Be wary of con artists of the esoteric.",

        'present': "When the High Priestess is in the present position, you’re advised to never believe what’s presented as the truth. The skills you developed in the past will apply here, making it easier for you to avoid a bad situation. Is your partner insisting on you moving in together, despite your objections? Do you sense that someone walking down the street is following you too closely? Follow these hunches — you’ll be grateful that you did.",

        'future': "In the future position, the High Priestess means that you’re headed towards a conflict that should be defused or avoided altogether. Use your foresight to guide you to the best outcome. This card is one that knows without knowing — use that ability to better your future.",

These might have been romantic, business, artistic, or personal opportunities, but so long as you continue along the same path you’ve been following all this time, you can be confident even greater successes will be forthcoming.",

        'present': "In the present, the Empress is a sign that you need to be sensitive to the emotional needs and well-being of people around you. Like it or not, you are seen as a savior of sorts to these people and have no choice but to be supportive and genuinely empathetic to their concerns. A new beginning may be awaiting you.",

        'future': "In the future position, the Empress indicates that a much needed period of emotional and possible physical healing awaits you. Be open to new experiences. If you play your cards right, all that effort which has left you weak and emotionally exhausted will eventually pay off.",

        'present': "In the present position, the Emperor means that there’s a good chance you’re about to be introduced to a celebrity or famous person who was one of your childhood heroes. At the same time, there is an individual in your life who is introducing you to a new way of being, a more positive approach that this person, likely an older, powerful male, personifies.",

        'future': "In the future position, the Emperor tarot card indicates that you are developing a new, more conservative mindset that will eventually have an impact on your political leanings, which in turn could negatively affect several of your personal relationships. A powerful male figure will be the impetus behind your apparent political awakening. However, this person is not to be trusted and will prove to be a negative force whose teachings only bring you, along with the people who love you, harm.",

        'past': "In the past position, the Hierophant indicates that you’ve benefited more than you realize from your past ambitions, whether they were realized at the time or not. Determine where this strength within you lies, and apply it to your benefit under your present circumstances.",

        'present': "As an indicator of your present situation, the Hierophant represents a new way of living and belief system that could be taking a hold and motivating you in a positive manner. However, you need to move slowly and carefully, and don’t dive into any new venture without first giving it your full consideration.",

        'future': "In the future position, the Hierophant is suggesting that you don’t need to do anything special to plan for your future right now. Everything is as it should be and will organically unfold in a positive fashion.",

        'past': "Finding the Lovers in the past position indicates that a romantic relationship is the foundation of your identity. If you have been with the same person for a long time, it represents the stability of your relationship. If you are in a newer relationship, it may indicate that your feelings for a former love are still governing your choices.",

        'present': "In the present position, the Lovers card means that a relationship is developing and will bring passion and happiness. It can also indicate that a period of loneliness is about to come to an end, possibly with a new love or with personal growth and acceptance. In either case, the situation will be a transformative one.",

        'future': "In the future position, the Lovers card indicates that the time is right to seek out love, while maintaining a clear understanding of your expectations. Don’t settle for less, and don’t be afraid to go for what you want. If you are in a relationship, communicate your needs to your partner. This card is a sign that their response will be positive.",

In some cases, Strength in the past position refers to your ability to consistently seek new challenges, never settling into a single position for too long. Essentially, Strength in the past signifies transition and victory through your iron will to hold it all together.",

        'present': "In the present position, the Strength card is a challenge to take on more. Do not turn down opportunities simply because they are risky or difficult. The odds are in your favor, and now is the time to invest yourself in uncertain ventures that you are passionate about.",

        'future': "In the future position, Strength is an encouragement, promising that your current troubles will soon be under control, and might even contribute to your success.",

        'present': "When Justice is in the present position, it is a sign that you are at an impasse. You will not be able to make this decision alone — you must ask for advice, even if that makes you feel vulnerable. These choices will set the foundations for many years to come.",

        'future': "Drawn in the future position, Justice means that any past wrongs you have suffered will be righted. Those who have hurt you will face justice, and you will emerge victorious with the respect and admiration of your community.",

        'past': "In the past position, Judgement indicates that your current life is the end result of a single major decision that you made in the past. Day to day living obliges all of us to make decisions both large and small, but you made one decision that left an indelible mark on your life, for better or worse. Perhaps you chose to move away from home in college or drop out of school. Maybe you got caught stealing, or found the love of your life on a blind date. It can be hard to think of your life unfolding any other way than it has, but if you had made this one choice differently, your own life would be unrecognizable to you.",

Perhaps you will move to a faraway city only to move back home thereafter, or leave your job for a new opportunity and return in the long run. This shouldn’t be seen as a bad sign — your return will be wholly voluntary and triumphant.",
